## The Job
A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## The Task

Website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code

HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes

Heading attributes fall in sequential order

Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
